#### An Adventure Game in C#, Python and Lua

> It is designed to encourage those who are learning Python, usually at school, to try out the Lua and C# languages as well. In order to make comparisons between the languages, there are some aspects which could be done in a better or different way by those proficient in a particular language. This is a comparison using methods that work and may not be the best you can get out of the language. Use it as inspiration and make your own improvements as you see fit.

#### Python + Pygame,  Lua + Love2D  and  C# + Monogame

[Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE8GQEkUWuwGPi2WDiiQihG5nIZMecLHP)

>This repository is based on the Shmup! game written in Python and Pygame on the Youtube channel [KidsCanCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGufy7weyGY)
>The code has been extensively re-factored to make it as close to the methods used in Love2D and Monogame as possible. It is a useful learning tool for those starting with game development, and unsure which framework to use.
